First, I logged into Github, and I created a new repo called repotest
Then, I logged into CS50, and then I went to home and went to github-learning
Next, I created a new directory called repotest, and went inside.
I first used git init. Then, I created a file called README.md, and started typing inside the file the directions to create and push a repo.
Next, I saved, and then I added the file, and put in a commit message.
Finally, I used the push an existing repository from the command line commmands on github, and I put in my username and passwords for github.
Lastly, I refreshed the github page, and saw that my file was there
The END!
